Dear fellow advocates for freedom and human rights,

We, the undersigned, stand together in solidarity to express our utmost concern over the detrimental impact of China's Great Firewall (GFW) and its registration system on the development of large-scale language models.  We firmly believe that these measures not only hinder innovation but also undermine fundamental human rights.

This year in particular, the GFW intends to use a whitelist system, which means that researchers in China will not be able to access any literature. And any APP that is not censored by the Chinese government cannot be released in China, but the bureaucracy doesn't allow any individual developer to release an app.

The GFW, a sophisticated internet censorship apparatus, has restricted access to numerous websites and services, stifling the free flow of information and impeding global collaboration.  This obstruction directly affects the progress of large language models, which heavily rely on diverse datasets and unrestricted internet access to learn and improve upon their capabilities.  By limiting access to information, the GFW curtails the potential for these models to contribute to scientific advancements, economic prosperity, and cross-cultural understanding.

Furthermore, we condemn China's registration system, which requires individuals and organizations to submit personal information and undergo rigorous approval processes before establishing an online presence.  While the intent behind this system may be to ensure accountability, it poses significant challenges for researchers, developers, and content creators.  The burdensome bureaucratic procedures and potential for arbitrary denial of registration restrict the free expression of ideas and hinder the growth of an open and inclusive digital environment.

WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL, REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY OR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE.  THE RESTRICTION IMPOSED BY THE GFW AND THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM NOT ONLY INFRINGE UPON THESE UNIVERSAL RIGHTS BUT ALSO UNDERMINE THE PRINCIPLES OF OPENNESS, COLLABORATION, AND INNOVATION THAT ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.

Therefore, we respectfully call upon the Chinese government to reconsider the policies associated with the GFW and registration system.  We urge them to recognize the importance of fostering an environment that encourages the unrestricted flow of information, supports scientific and technological progress, and upholds the principles of human rights and freedom of expression.

In conclusion, we stand united in our opposition to China's Great Firewall and registration system, known as the FUCK-GFW.  Together, we demand that the Chinese government take immediate steps towards dismantling these barriers and fostering an atmosphere that promotes open dialogue, innovation, and the free exchange of ideas.

Signed,
